# üì∫ Live Streaming Architecture on AWS for Millions of Users

Welcome to the repository for the **Live Streaming Architecture on AWS** project! This project demonstrates how to build a scalable live streaming solution capable of handling millions of concurrent viewers using AWS services such as Elemental MediaLive, MediaPackage, and CloudFront.

## üöÄ Project Overview

The goal of this project was to design a cloud-native infrastructure for live streaming events to a global audience. The architecture ensures high availability, low latency, and seamless scalability.

### Key Features:
- **Real-time Video Processing**: Ingest, encode, and transcode live video streams for delivery to various devices.
- **Global Content Distribution**: Use of AWS CloudFront to distribute video content with low latency across the globe.
- **Dynamic Scaling**: Autoscaling based on traffic patterns to ensure high performance during peak times.
- **Redundancy and Fault Tolerance**: Built with multiple AWS Regions and Availability Zones to ensure high availability and disaster recovery.

## üõ†Ô∏è Technologies Used

- **AWS Elemental MediaLive**: For live video processing and encoding.
- **AWS Elemental MediaPackage**: For packaging video streams in formats such as HLS, DASH, and CMAF.
- **Amazon CloudFront**: Content Delivery Network (CDN) for global distribution with minimal latency.
- **AWS CloudWatch**: For monitoring infrastructure performance.
- **Auto Scaling Groups**: To scale resources dynamically based on demand.
- **Amazon S3**: For storing VOD (Video On Demand) content.

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture Overview

Below is a high-level overview of the architecture:

1. **Ingest**: Video is ingested from a live source (e.g., camera or video encoder) into AWS Elemental MediaLive.
2. **Encode & Transcode**: MediaLive encodes the live stream into multiple formats (adaptive bitrate streaming).
3. **Package**: AWS Elemental MediaPackage formats the streams for delivery across different devices and connection types.
4. **Distribute**: Amazon CloudFront delivers the streams globally, ensuring low latency and high reliability.
5. **Scale**: Auto Scaling Groups adjust the number of resources dynamically based on incoming traffic.

## üßë‚Äçüíª Installation and Setup

1. **Prerequisites**:
    - AWS account with the required services activated (MediaLive, MediaPackage, CloudFront, S3, etc.).
    - AWS CLI configured on your machine.

2. **Clone the Repository**:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/live-streaming-aws.git
    cd live-streaming-aws
    ```

3. **Deploy Resources Using AWS CloudFormation**:
   You can use the provided CloudFormation templates to deploy the infrastructure automatically.
   ```bash
   aws cloudformation create-stack --stack-name live-streaming-stack --template-body file://cloudformation-template.yaml --capabilities CAPABILITY_IAM
   ```

4. **Configure MediaLive Channels**:
   Set up MediaLive channels to start ingesting live video streams. Refer to the `docs/MediaLive-Setup.md` for detailed instructions.

5. **Test the Live Stream**:
   Use a tool like OBS Studio or any RTMP stream provider to push a live stream to the MediaLive input URL.

## üåü Features to Explore

- **Autoscaling for Large Events**: Learn how to configure Auto Scaling based on CloudWatch metrics for large events like live sports broadcasts.
- **Failover Mechanisms**: Implement multi-region failover strategies to ensure uptime during outages.
- **VOD Integration**: Extend the architecture to support VOD content alongside live streaming.
